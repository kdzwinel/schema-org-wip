Having had a bad experience an d having been badly ripped off jewellery shopping in Colombo in the past it was a pleasure to meet a family who treated one with respect and we\\'re not pushy in any way and who did not try to sell something not wanted. The owners were most accommodating in making a piece at short notice and were very expert in their knowledge of gemstones and very generous in sharing their knowledge\\nHighly recommended!",
